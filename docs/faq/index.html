                When in doubt, err on the side of less polished, more thought-provoking. 
                Provide enough background information to get the audience on the same page, 
                but don’t present a research project that already has produced a conference-ready set of results. 
                Several successful workshop talks had no prepared slides, but sparked memorable and productive discussion.

                While we can’t predict the pandemic conditions for March/April 2024, we 
                will take necessary precautions in case of a surge. In previous years 
                we have adapted to different COVID caution levels by holding presentations 
                outdoors, masking in the shared accommodation, and providing limited on-site testing.

                Participants stay in shared accommodation, with presentations given 
                in the common space on site. Participants may be assigned to share a room (by default, 
                with someone of the same gender). Please contact the organizers if
                 sharing a room is an issue for you.
