    <h2>4th Annual Gathering</h2>
    <p>
        The Learning Workshop is a selective gathering for junior researchers in machine learning, offering a 
        platform to share exciting and unpublished ideas. Set in the picturesque backdrop of 
        <b>Fuerteventura, Spain from March 30 - April 3, 2024,</b> this 3-day workshop is an assembly of 
        approximately 20 individuals comprising students, 
        early-career professors, and industry professionals. Each attendee will have an opportunity to showcase their 
        thoughts in a <b>15-minute presentation</b>, paving the way for an engaging 
        <b>45-minute Q&A session</b>. 
        These talks should veer away from published works and focus on problems rather than solutions, 
        emphasizing potential challenges ripe for breakthroughs in the coming 2-4 years. 
        The workshop aims to promote deep and exploratory dialogues. <b>All presentations and discussions
        are off the record</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Holding inclusivity at its core, the workshop is a committed to <b>equal representation</b> across diverse genders, races, 
        and nationalities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Past attendes have included researchers at Google Research, DeepMind, The Allen Institute, Meta AI Research, 
        Waymo, Berkeley AI Research Lab, Stanford University, MIT, NYU, Princeton University, Harvard University,
        Oxford University, and more. Tracing its lineage, The Learning Workshop is a nod to its predecessor 
        at Snowbird, which later evolved into the iconic NeurIPS conference.
